# Types of Physical Barries

## Fence Barriers
- most orgs use these to prevent unauthorized entry
- may be used in certain areas for protecting things

Types of Gates
1. Residential
2. Commercial
3. Insdustrial/limited access
4. Restricted access operation requiring supervisory control (on base)

## Bollards
- pylons to prevent vehicles from entering
- hitec can be mechnaical 

## Signage
- deters people from doing something
- do not enter
- authorized people only
- beware of dog etc

# Camera and Surveillance Methods
- proovide way to monitor and record the propertt permieter
- consider deterrent and detective physical controls
- delvier a way to record intruders in action
- should trigger alert if offline

> - inside webcams or outside
> - CC to ourtide party?
> - should include good lighting
> - need to locate dead spots
> - back up video to safe location

## Industrial camo

- cameras can be hidden places
- fake trees


# Personnel COntrols
- Many guests will have guests register at reception
- Collect and input id into visitor log
    - sometimes background checks are amde
- Guests may need to always be escorted

## Security Guards

- may be 247 but could be buesinnes hours
- mutiple types
    - detective
    - deterrent
    - preventative
- They can provide rapid sec response if an intrusion occurs

## Security considerations
- hire or contract?
- armed?
- What is impact to sinurace?
- are you involved with screening?
- what about training?

## Robots
- can be used in home or commercial
- Samsung SGR-A1 is a sentry gun developed with Korea Uni to support S Korean troops in DMZ

# Locking Mechanisms

- Locks are physical security
- only delays -- not prevent in long run
- Every lock can be exploded

## PIcking Locks

- Use picks to do tension wrench to rotate key plug to find lock tumblers
- Then pick used to move binding tumblers, to shear the line
- When all tumblers alligned properly with shear line, lock opens

## Raking Locks
- wider tip pushed in all the way
- pulled out, then some pins will lock
- the rest easily picked

## Brute Force Locks
- destroying them

## Types of locks
- Key lock - needs key
- warded - obstructions to keyhole to allow only properly cut key
- wager/tumbler - form lock body 
- pin rumbler - where key moves pin
- Deadbolt
    - inserted to frame
- Interchangable core
    - can be removed and replaced with special key
- Combination
    - need special order
- Electeonic combo
    - obtain power from energy when dials turned
- Keyless
    - uses buttons pushed in sequency
- Smart lock
    - uses plastic card
- Cable locks
    - secure laptops to ddesk
- USB Data blockers
    - prevent from usb attacks to happen

# Fire controls

## Prevention
    - fire rated materielas and training

## Detection
- Smoke and fire detectors

## Suppression
- contain and extribuish the fire

## Fire Controls

- Type A
    - common combustibles, paper, laminates
        - supressed with dry chemical, wet chemical, water, foam
- Type B
    - combustible lqiuids
        - suppressed with halon subs, dry chemical, clean agen foam, carbon dioxide
- Type C
    - Electrical wiring
        - extribguised with dry chemical, clean agent, water mist, and carbon dioxide
- Type D cobustible metals
    - Only supprsed with dry poweder
- Type K
    - Unique to cooking
    - extiguished with dry powder

# Types of Sensors

- Lighting is most common
    - lots of things depend on it
    - can show attackers and ward them off
- Enchances other sensors, cameras, sec guards
- Mercury Vapor
    - privde good light outside
- Sodium vapor
    - provide it for outdoor
- Quartz
    - flood lights
- LED
    - good for indside
- Continous lighting
- Trip lighting
    - when something trips it
- Standby lighting
    - in case other lighting not avaulable
- Emergency lighting

> - photoelectric sensors
>   - break in light
> - Passive infered - detecting IR light 
> - Vibration - chagne in vibration
> - Acoutaical - noise
> - Microwave - change in high freq radio waves
> - electro mechnical - brak in electrical circuit
> - elctrostatic - change in electro static field
> - Moisture and temp detection  - for server rooms and data center environmental controls

## Sensors and Trigger alarms
- static light
- bells rings
- SMS or txt
- Teleophone or SW
- Silent alarms
    - to catch attacker


# Secure Areas

## Man Traps
- Cages to control access
- entry/exit door but only one is open at a time
- One person at a time
    - to be authenticated
        - provide id
        - can incldue biometric
        - CCTV
        - Sec gaurd
        - electronic locks

## Faraday Cages
- things to protect from EMP
-  shield fashioned from continous covering
- often in Data cetnrs or otehr enterprise safe rooms

## Cable Runs and Distrbution Frames

- remember all cable rund and MDF rooms
     - under floors
     - above cieling panels 

## Safe and Vaults
- where most valuable coprorate physcial assets stored
- should be attached to physical infastructure
- COnsiderations:
    - location
    - fire proof
    - type of lock (MFA)
    - weight
    - strnegth
    - relocking devices (timers)
    - timers and alarms

## Air Gap
- secury system with no internet
- very limite lAN
- phycsial or logical
- still vulenrable
- stuxnet was on airgapped netwrok
> - military networks
> - very senesitive networks

## hot and Cold Aisles
- Poor HVAC can lead to extream heat, cold, humidity or dryness
- reommended temps are 72 to 76
- reommended humidity is 40 -60%
- maintain hot and cold aisles

# Secure Data Destruction
- Data sanitation
> - degausing - rmeoving magnetic field of physcal drive
> - pruging - cleanign everything off the media 
> - wipiing - OW every sectory of drive with 1s and 0s
> - encrpypting before deleting

Options:
- Bruning
- Shredding
    - when using 3rd party, secure in mean time
- Pulping
    - good since it obliterated
- Pulverziing
- Third party solutions
